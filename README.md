# Classical Molecular Dynamics

This repository contains **LAMMPS input files** and **Python analysis scripts** used for classical molecular dynamics simulations.  

All theoretical explanations, derivations, and concepts are documented on my blog:  
[https://azam-alif.github.io](https://azam-alif.github.io)

## Contents

- `lammps/` – Input scripts for LAMMPS simulations.
- `analysis/` – Python scripts for processing simulation output, generating plots, and visualizing results.


## Usage

1. Run the LAMMPS input files to generate simulation data.  
2. Use the Python scripts in the `analysis/` folder to process the output and generate plots.  

For detailed theory, explanation of each simulation, and discussion of results, refer to the blog linked above.
